### [Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/) | [Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/andresgarbarz/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8)
## Description
Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page. And they use JavaScript to make that page interactive.

In this JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.

You'll also learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.

#### Disclaimer
*This course is different from [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/andresgarbarz/FreeCodeCamp/tree/main/JS-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures) (even though they have practically the same name) because this one covers Front End Development specific content (HTML, CSS, DOM Handling, Local Storage, Fetch API) and has 1 complete different project.*
